Tetouan City Power Consumption Dataset

The Tetouan City Power Consumption dataset contains real electricity consumption data collected from three distribution zones in Tetouan, Morocco. The dataset includes hourly power consumption measurements along with meteorological variables such as temperature, humidity, and wind speed. It is widely used for load forecasting, time-series analysis, and non-stationary data stream studies.
