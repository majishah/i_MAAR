## Description
The Tetouan City Power Consumption dataset contains real electricity consumption data recorded from **three distribution zones of Tetouan city, Morocco**. The dataset provides **hourly power consumption measurements** along with associated **weather variables**, including temperature, humidity, and wind speed. It is widely used for **load forecasting, time-series analysis, and non-stationary data stream studies**.

## Usage in This Research
The dataset is used to evaluate **streaming forecasting, adaptive learning, and drift detection algorithms** under **non-stationary conditions**.

## Download Instructions
The dataset can be downloaded directly from the official **UCI Machine Learning Repository** using the link provided above.
