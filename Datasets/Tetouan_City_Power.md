The Tetouan City Power Consumption dataset contains real electricity consumption data recorded from three distribution zones of Tetouan, Morocco. It includes hourly power consumption along with weather variables such as temperature, humidity, and wind speed, and is widely used for load forecasting, time-series analysis, and non-stationary data stream studies.
